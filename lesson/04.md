### Repeat the steps from the LEARN section 
* Walk through every step
* Setup and install the required software
* You now should have a copy of Mark's home page


### Home page - bacs200 landing page
* Your home page should be at "Documents/bacs200/index.html"
* Customize the content using Brackets
* Commit and push changes using Github Desktop
* This the default landing page for all other projects


### Test Your Page
* Run the browser on your file "Documents/bacs200/index.html"
* You should have 
    * a photo of you
    * a link to your WordPress blog page
    * a link to your Github account
    * your name set in the headline
    * your name set in the title


### View in Windows File Explorer
* Visit your files in Windows


### File Names
* Beware: Case Sensitive Files
    * Windows sees "Bacs" and "bacs" and "BACS" as the same file
    * Bluehost sees "Bacs" and "bacs" and "BACS" as different files
* No files that go on the web server can have spaces
* All files that go on the web server should be all lowercase


### [Project 2](/unc/bacs200/project/02)
