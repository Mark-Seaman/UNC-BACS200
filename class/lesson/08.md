Seaman's Rule #8 - Test it or remove it

---

### Review
* Tools you can use
    * Bluehost
    * Brackets & Firefox
    * Github & Github Desktop 
    * Filezilla

### Today
* Test pages with Sensei links and Web Browser
* Test with HTML validator

### [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
* Web service that scans your page
* Reports all HTML errors
* URL, File, HTML Text

### How to use the Validator
* Some errors produce a lot of output (slot machine jackpot)
* Only work on the first error

### Move on when good enough
* Always fix the most critical errors
* Some errors are hard to fix
* Law of diminishing returns

### Screen shots
* Create folder "03/images"
* Run Snippet
* Capture screenshot
* Put screenshot in folder "03/images"

### Validate Your Home Page
* Go to the [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
* Bookmark this page
* Select your domain URL
* Validate your page
* Fix all errors

### Capture a screenshot
* Post the screenshot as "bacs200/03/images/validator.png"
* This is proof that you can run the validator

### Screenshots of FTP configuration
* Run Filezilla and take three screenshots
* Make it look like Mark's demo at [Demo Server](https://unco-bacs.org/bacs200/03/)
* This is proof that you setup Filezilla
