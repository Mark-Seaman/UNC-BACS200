```
<a href="new_page.html">Link Text</a>
```


### a
* "a" is for anchor

```
<a href="new_page.html">Link Text</a>
```


### Anchor href
* The URL is set by the href attribute

```
<a href="new_page.html">Link Text</a>
```


### Anchor Inner Text (link text)
* The Link Text is inside the a tag
* Study this example

```
<a href="new_page.html">Link Text</a>
```


### Anchor target
* The target attribute can bring up a new tab

```
<a href="new_page.html" target="_new">Link Text</a>
```


### Image
* Images can be embedded in a page
* When the page is loaded in the browser the images are all fetched from the server

### img

```
<img src="logo.png" alt="Logo">
