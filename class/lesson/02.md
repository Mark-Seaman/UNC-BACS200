    * Protocol
    * Domain
    * Directory Path
    * Filename (including suffix)
    
    
### Example URLs

    * Protocol - https:
    * Domain - www.unco.edu
    * Directory Path - images/branding

### Is your page secure?

### Working with Word Press

### Your Online Presence

* Build a few articles (5 to start, 10 make you a blogger)
